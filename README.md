# Product Search Angular App

## The Assignment

Create either a console or a UI application that displays products for sale.

The products are available in this web service: https://dummyjson.com/products. 

Products can be filtered using a path
segment, this will return a product with an ID of 1 https://dummyjson.com/products/1 and this will filter all products that
have “laptop” in the title or description: https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=Laptop.


## Installing / Running Locally

Install npm if not already installed. Can use nvm to accomplish this: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm (npm version 10+ (and node version 18+) recommended).

Run `npm i` after cloning repository. 

Run `ng serve` to host application on `localhost:4200`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
